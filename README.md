# gtimelog_cli
A simple CLI interface for logging time into GTimeLog

In order to use this script, simply put it into a location pointed to by your $PATH.

If you call the script without any arguments, it will parse your ~/.local/share/gtimelog/tasks.txt and prompt you for a selection.
In addition, you can call it with an arbitrary amount of parameters which then get appended into your timelog.txt with the correct timestamp.

I wrote this for not having to use the mouse for logging times onto my projects, and published it here hoping it is useful for anyone.
